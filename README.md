# General #
This game was developed by a small team in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 51. Players control a character that can jump and use a water gun to manipulate objects, pushing balls and triggering changes in the environment. The key mechanic is the timed swap every ten seconds between the two worlds, forcing players to plan their jumps and actions in sync with the cycle. Further information is provided on [itch.io](https://wearedev.itch.io/flip-and-swap), where the game can be played online or downloaded for Windows.
